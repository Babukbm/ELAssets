  <h2>Digital Coupon Help</h2>
  <p><span>Country Mart now offers digital coupons to its members!  It’s easy, just register and add your Country Mart rewards card number to your member profile.  Sign in and access digital coupons through the <b>Savings Center</b> link, the <b>Coupons</b> tab or from the home page bulletin board.  Click “add to card” for the coupons that you would like to redeem.  Add the qualifying items to your order in the store and present your card.  The coupons come off automatically, no paper coupon is needed!  Now for the best part, Country Mart will <b>double</b> qualifying digital coupons just like the paper coupons!
