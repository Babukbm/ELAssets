		<BodyText>Using specials as the foundation for your recipes means you save on the large budget items and have fun with new recipes or old favorites. You can plan most, or all, of your weekly meals, using our recipe database. Planning your meals with our website means you won&#39;t forget things, and more important, you can build meals around the items that are on special â€“ items you probably can&#39;t find in the circulars or ads, but that are on special nonetheless.</BodyText>
